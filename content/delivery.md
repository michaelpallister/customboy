## Delivery

We aim to post all orders within one working day of purchase. Sometimes there may be other factors that mean we can't adhere to this. In this instance, we will contact you and let you know.

Once your order has been shipped, we will update your order with a tracking number that you can then use to track your parcel.

All deliveries will require a signature.

If you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase, we're here to help.

## Returns

You have 30 (change this) calendar days to return an item from the date you received it.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it.

Your item must be in the original packaging.

Your item needs to have the receipt or proof of purchase.

You will be responsible for paying the shipping costs for returning your item.

## Refunds

Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we have received your returned item. We will immediately notify you on the status of your refund after inspecting the item.

If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your method of payment.
