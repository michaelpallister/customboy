Jellybelly Customs are now selling the [Game Boy Color LCD Spacers](http://www.jellybellycustoms.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=115) separately. 

This is a great move, especially if you're purchasing any of your LCD options in bulk. Previously the option was to purchase a kit which came with the spacers, or to 3D print your own.

If you're using the Chinese LCD then you can leave the small bumps on the printed spacer. However, the other LCDs require you to sand/trim these off.
