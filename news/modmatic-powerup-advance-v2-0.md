modmatic have released v2.0 of their popular Game Boy Advance rechargeable battery pack, the [PowerUp Advance](https://modmatic.io/products/powerup-advance?item=APU-003).

v2.0 of the product now includes a USB-C connection in place of the micro-USB and a 1700mAh battery instead of the 1000mAh the 1.2v had.

As with v1.2, no soldering is required to fit this mod. They do require you make a few small case modifications but this should be a quick mod for anybody wanting to fit a rechargeable battery into their GBA.

modmatic are saying the 1700mAh battery will return up to 16 hours of gaming on a backlit screen, this will be a lot more if you're still running the stock screen on your GBA.

They've also created a [Light Pipe](https://modmatic.io/products/light-pipe-pua?item=LP-002), a power/low-battery indicator which can be installed directly into your battery cover.
