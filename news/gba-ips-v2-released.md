After the huge success of the first version, the guys over at FunnyPlaying.com have released v2 of their popular IPS LCD screen.

This addresses the small issue of screen tearing which was noticeable on most top-down games. They've managed to synchronise the GBA clock and screen clock to fix the tear.

This is a great upgrade for anyone wanting a better screen in their GBA. The screen is slightly larger than the AGS-101 and we find the colours much better.
