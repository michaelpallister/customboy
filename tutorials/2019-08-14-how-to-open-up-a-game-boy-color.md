## Step 1

Turn the Game Boy Color over and remove the battery cover. You now have access to the six screws you need to remove on the back. For these, you will need the Tri-point Y0 screwdriver.

## Step 2

Once you've removed the six screws from the back you should be able to open the shell. To remove the mainboard from the front of the shell you must use the Phillips #00 screwdriver and remove the three screws highlighted below.

## Step 3

Gently flip the board over the top of the shell and remove the ribbon cable. Be careful not damage the cable. You can either use your nail or some tweezers to push both the hinges on either side up. Once they are up, gently pull the ribbon cable out.
